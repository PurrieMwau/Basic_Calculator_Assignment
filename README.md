Here is a README file for your code that performs basic arithmetic operations on two input numbers:

# Simple Arithmetic Operations

## Description
This is a small Python script that takes two numbers as input from the user and calculates the **sum**, **difference**, **product**, and **quotient** of these numbers. It then prints out the results.

## How to Use
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. When prompted, enter the **first number**.
3. Enter the **second number**.
4. The program will display the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.

## Features
- Takes two floating-point numbers as input.
- Calculates:
  - Sum
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Quotient
- Displays the results in a clear format.
- Includes a message indicating division by zero error (though this is currently always printed).

## Code Example
```python
a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

sum_result = a + b
difference_result = a - b
product_result = a * b
quotient_result = a / b

print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  
print(f"Product: {product_result}")  
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")  
print("Error: Cannot divide by zero")
```

If you want, I can also help you improve the code to properly handle divisioy zero and other cases.
